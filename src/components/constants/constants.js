export const INTRO_TEXT = `I'm Mitchell Dorward. A recent graduate from Lehigh University who grew up in Pottstown, PA and recently moved to Knoxville, TN. I have a passion for
finding creative solutions to complex problems. I love to create products that real people can use to better engage with the things they love or need. Some of my best examples of this 
are in my personal projects. I specialize in full-stack development and am intimately familiar with web technologies like Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, etc. as well as backend languages like
C++, C, SQL, JavaScript, etc.`
export const EDUCATION_TEXT = `I am a 2025 graduate from Lehigh University. I graduated with a 3.71 GPA with a major in Computer Science in the Rossin College of Engineering. I also
graduated with minors in Spanish & Music.`;
export const BEYOND_CLASSES_TEXT = `I was a grader / teacher's assistant for Professor Lee-Urban for CSE 348: Game AI. In this role I increased grading efficiency
by creating autograders for the different assignments. These autograders were all set up using the same baseplate so that they will be easy to maintain. I also hosted office hours
and fielded questions from students taking the class.`;
export const EXTRACURRICULARS_TEXT = `I participated in many different music ensembles for the entirety of my stay at Lehigh: Brass Ensemble, Wind Ensemble,
Marching 97, & Jazz Orchestra.`;
export const UNITE_PRO_TEXT = `This is my project that I have taken the furthest. It is a live website that you can find at unite-pro.net! The webapp that has two main draws; 1: it
serves as a draft sim where users can practice drafting alone, with others online, or versus an AI. 2: I use this webapp to store and do data anlysis on pro matches. These are two
niches that are completely unfilled anywhere else in the Pokemon Unite community so I wanted to create the webapp for myself and others to use. The Webapp is hosted on Heroku with
a database on Supabase. The webapp is completely stateless and employs AI techniques like planning and A* search. For the future: I have broken every Pokemon down into their core 
attributes and once I have gathered enough data, I plan to train a better AI using deep learning, I am just limited by data right now.`
export const UNITE_PRO_DESCRIPTION = `Unite-Pro is a draft-sim and pro stat tracker that is used to help competitive players improve at the game Pokemon Unite. The webapp teaches players 
by allowing them to draft by themselves, against an AI, or against other players online. The AI is primarily made using A* search and planning with future plans to use deep learning 
as I collect more data. The stat tracker lets users view and filter old matches to review what is important to them, view and filter individual character stats to find which characters 
are effective in different scenarios, and perform data analysis on team comps to understand what lets a pokemon thrive or be countered.`;
export const ENROLLD_DESCRIPTION = `Enrolld is a project I worked on for a full year as my Senior Capstone. It is a webapp designed to help faciliate communication between students
and advisors. The idea is to have students create their expected schedules for future semesters many months, or even years, early. This way that data can be collected and coordinators
can use it to more accurately create classes and electives that students need and are interested in. I did work on both the frontend and backend, mostly creating new frontend features
and creating backend functions and routes that the frontend then uses. In this project I learned to coordinate with 3 other students to be efficient and avoid merge conflicts. The group
also demo'd to stakeholder weekly and would be responsible for tracking their feedback and implementing it.`
export const DATA_ANNOTATION_DESCRIPTION = `DataAnnotation is a company specializing in creating high-quality, complex training data for AI models. This is my job as an AI Trainer.
I am often given AI responses to prompts that were not correct, usually in the realm of computer science. My job is to correct these responses which involves researching information
about specific plugins, obscure languages, etc and quickly becoming familiar enough with them to correct the response. I sometimes may create difficult prompts and correct them
myself too.`;
export const MONROE_DESCRIPTION = `Monroe Energy is an energy company, specifically focused on gasoline and jet fuel production. During my time here, I worked at their pipeline, MIPC.
In my summer worker role most of my tasks were centered on improving the efficiency of future work. I would handle tasks like filling out permits, performing inspections of the tanks 
that store the fuel, and labeling / documenting every valve and instrument on the pipeline.`;
