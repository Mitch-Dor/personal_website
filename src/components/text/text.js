export const INTRO_TEXT = `I'm Mitchell Dorward. A recent graduate from Lehigh University who grew up in Pottstown, PA and recently moved to Knoxville, TN. I have a passion for
finding creative solutions to complex problems. I love to create products that real people can use to better engage with the things they love or need. Some of my best examples of this 
are in my personal projects. I specialize in full-stack development and am intimately familiar with web technologies like Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, etc. as well as backend languages like
C++, C, SQL, JavaScript, etc.`

graduated with minors in Spanish & Music.`;
export const BEYOND_CLASSES_TEXT = `I was a grader / teacher's assistant for Professor Lee-Urban for CSE 348: Game AI. In this role I increased grading efficiency
by creating autograders for the different assignments. These autograders were all set up using the same baseplate so that they will be easy to maintain. I also hosted office hours
and fielded questions from students taking the class.`;

export const UNITE_PRO_TEXT = `This is my project that I have taken the furthest. It is a live website that you can find at unite-pro.net! The webapp that has two main draws; 1: it
serves as a draft sim where users can practice drafting alone, with others online, or versus an AI. 2: I use this webapp to store and do data anlysis on pro matches. These are two
niches that are completely unfilled anywhere else in the Pokemon Unite community so I wanted to create the webapp for myself and others to use. The Webapp is hosted on Heroku with
a database on Supabase. The webapp is completely stateless and employs AI techniques like planning and A* search. For the future: I have broken every Pokemon down into their core 
attributes and once I have gathered enough data, I plan to train a better AI using deep learning, I am just limited by data right now.`
